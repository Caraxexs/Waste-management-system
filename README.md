AI-Powered Waste Management Classifier App

An intelligent mobile/web-based application that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify waste as **biodegradable** or **non-biodegradable**. The system supports real-time image capture**, provides **classification feedback**, and includes a **smart chatbot (Jarvis)** to assist users in tracking waste processing and learning about proper segregation.
